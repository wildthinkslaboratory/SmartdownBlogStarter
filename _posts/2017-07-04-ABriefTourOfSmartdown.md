title: A Brief Tour of Smartdown
smartdown: true
---




Smartdown is an extension of Markdown that includes several additions:

- Technical notation support, including [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org) LaTeX and AsciiMath syntax, chemical notation via [`mhchem`](https://mhchem.github.io/MathJax-mhchem/),
- Syntax highlighting via [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org).
- Reactive cells similar to those in a spreadsheet, but inline with Smartdown prose. These cells can be use for input, output, calculation, and for interacting with internet APIs such as Wikidata.
- Media embedding support including Images, Tweets, SVG, Video.
- [P5JS](https://p5js.org) to support drawing-based visualizations, games, and sound.
- [Plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/) to support data visualizations including various plots, charts, and maps.
- [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com) for easy embedding of geo-based data and maps.
- [Graphviz via `viz.js`](http://viz-js.com) diagrams are a standard format used for technical and scientific diagrams
- Much MuchMuchMuchMuch more


### Map of functionality

Use the navigation buttons below to explore different aspects of Smartdown.

- [Math](:@Math)
- [Plotly](:@Plotly)
- [Cells](:@Cells)
- [SVG](:@SVG)

Note that the above links are intra-document links in a MultiCard Smartdown document.

The links below, however, are inter-document links between one Smartdown document, and another. In both of these cases, no page-reload occurs and state is maintained.

### GIF Example

I'm experimenting with incorporating GIFs for the purpose of building a tutorial. Below is a short video of the [Smartdown Viewer](https://smartdown.site) being used to edit Smartdown:

# SVG
---

Smartdown allows SVG images to be registered and preprocessd so that they can be dynamically styled. For this example, we incorporate an SVG from [Wikimedia Hypercube](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hypercube.svg).

We can use ordinary Markdown image syntax:

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Hypercube.svg/500px-Hypercube.svg.png)

Or, we can use Smartdowns `/media` syntax and amend it with styling:

|hypercube|pulse|clockwise|cclockwise|bluegreen|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|![](/media/hypercube)|![](/media/hypercube/pulse)|![](/media/hypercube/clockwise)|![](/media/hypercube/cclockwise)|![](/media/hypercube/bluegreen)|
|![](/media/StalactiteStalagmite)|![](/media/StalactiteStalagmite/pulse)|![](/media/StalactiteStalagmite/clockwise)|![](/media/StalactiteStalagmite/cclockwise)|![](/media/StalactiteStalagmite/bluegreen)|

# Math
---

#### Math Example

By using MathJax, we can display all sorts of notation.

We can do inline math: $E = mc^2$

Or we can do block math:

$$
A \longrightarrow B
$$

$$
\begin{array}{c|lcr}
n & \text{Left} & \text{Center} & \text{Right} \\
\hline
1 & 0.24 & 1 & 125 \\
2 & -1 & 189 & -8 \\
3 & -20 & 2000 & 1+10i
\end{array}
$$

And even diagrams via *xyjax*:

$$
\begin{xy}
0;<1em,0em>:
(1,1);p+/v a(18) 5.5em/**@{-},
(1,3);p+/v a(18) 5.5em/**@2{-},
(1,5);p+/v a(18) 5.5em/**@3{-},
(1,9);p+/v a(18) 5.5em/**@{.},
(1,11);p+/v a(18) 5.5em/**@2{.},
(1,13);p+/v a(18) 5.5em/**@3{..},
\end{xy}
$$

#### MathJax $\LaTeX$ vs AsciiMath Syntax

Recently, I learned that MathJax had an alternative syntax, [AsciiMath](http://asciimath.org) that is simpler for many purposes. Smartdown has enabled this feature, although we are currently using `@` as the delimiter instead of \` or `$`.

##### $\LaTeX$ Syntax

Currently, Smartdown uses LaTeX-style math syntax, so the following formula:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3=\left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2
$$

is expressed as:

```
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3=\left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2
$$
```

##### AsciiMath Syntax

The above formula is expressed in AsciiMath (using `@` as delimiters) as:

```
@sum_(i=1)^n i^3=((n(n+1))/2)^2@
```

which Smartdown now renders as:

@sum_(i=1)^n i^3=((n(n+1))/2)^2@

Note that AsciiMath via MathJax does not support *display-mode* equations, but centering can be achieved via Markdown table syntax:

||
|:---:|
|@sum_(i=1)^n i^3=((n(n+1))/2)^2@|

```mermaid/playable

%% Example of sequence diagram

```mermaid/playable

   subgraph two
   b1-->b2[This is a really long label.]
   end
   subgraph three
   c1-->c2
   end
   c1-->a2
```

We can do inline math: $E = mc^2$

# Cells
---


## Cells - Reactive Spreadsheet Cells

Smartdown uses ordinary Markdown link syntax to specify a cell *label* and *body*, where the *label* is specified in the link label, and the *body* is specified in the link's URL. For example, the following declares an *output* cell that displays the value of the `FOO` variable:

```markdown
[The value of FOO is](:!FOO)
```

When a non-empty label is present, the cell will be formatted with its label on its own line. When no label is present, then the cell will be formatted inline.

### Cells with labels get their own line

- [What is your name?](:?NAME)
- [Glad to meet you](:!NAME)
- [What is your name again?](:?NAME)
- [Really glad to meet you](:!NAME)
- [Are you human?](:XHUMAN)
- [Humanity](:!HUMAN)


### Cells with no labels are inlined

What is your name? [](:?NAME) So glad to meet you [](:!NAME). What is your name again? [](:?NAME) Really glad to meet you [](:!NAME).
Are you human? [](:XHUMAN) Your Humanity is [](:!HUMAN).



### External Data Query

*The Smartdown code below is a work in progress and the syntax used is experimental and in flux.*

One of the goals of Smartdown is to enable simple text files to express rich interactive experiences that involve live data. Ideally, web-based services would already exist to serve the data-hunger of Smartdown. In this example, we are exploring the use of [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) as a data source.

Limitations of the current tech include:

- The [Falcor](https://netflix.github.io/falcor/) syntax is a hack and is not using the Falcor library.
- The current example emphasizes the extraction of thumbnail images from Wikidata and does not display or utilize the full set of metadata returned.

[WHAT do you want to look up?](:?WHAT)

Examples:
- Earth
- Penguin
- Uranium
- Oregon
- Abraham Lincoln
- [`WHAT`](:=LOOKUP=/wikidata["`WHAT`"])
- [`WHAT` thumbnails](:=LOOKUP=/wikidataThumbs["`WHAT`"])
- [`WHAT` images](:=LOOKUP=/wikidataImages["`WHAT`"])


- [Albert Einstein|Marie Curie|Max Plank (Slash, Thumbnails)](:=LOOKUP=/wikidataThumbs/Albert Einstein|Marie Curie|Max Plank)
- [Albert Einstein (Falcor, Thumbnails)](:=LOOKUP=/wikidataThumbs["Albert Einstein"])
- [Albert Einstein|Marie Curie|Max Plank (Slash, Original)](:=LOOKUP=/wikidataImages/Albert Einstein|Marie Curie|Max Plank)
- [Albert Einstein (Falcor, Original)](:=LOOKUP=/wikidataImages["Albert Einstein"])
- [Lookup result](:!LOOKUP)

# Plotly
---

## Plotly.js Experiments

The current integration of [plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/) is fairly raw, and you may encounter problems with autolayout/sizing as well as other features I haven't tested or fixed.

### Hello World

Here is the [Hello World](https://plot.ly/javascript/getting-started/#hello-world-example) example.


```plotly/playable
var layout = {
    title: 'Simple Line Graph',
    autosize: true,
    // width: 500,
    // height: 300,
    margin: {
      t: 100, b: 0, l: 0, r: 0
    }
};

Plotly.plot( this.div, [{
    x: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    y: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16] }], layout,
    {displayModeBar: true} );

```

### Maps

From [Chloropleth Map](https://plot.ly/javascript/choropleth-maps)

```plotly/playable

var myDiv = this.div;
Plotly.d3.csv(
  'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/2010_alcohol_consumption_by_country.csv',
  function(err, rows) {
    function unpack(rows, key) {
      return rows.map(function(row) { return row[key]; });
    }

    var data = [{
      type: 'choropleth',
      locationmode: 'country names',
      locations: unpack(rows, 'location'),
      z: unpack(rows, 'alcohol'),
      text: unpack(rows, 'location'),
      autocolorscale: true
    }];

    var layout = {
      autosize: true,
      title: 'Pure alcohol consumption among adults (age 15+) in 2010',
      geo: {
        projection: {
          type: 'robinson'
        }
      }
    };

    Plotly.newPlot(myDiv, data, layout, {showLink: false, displayModeBar: true});
  });

```
